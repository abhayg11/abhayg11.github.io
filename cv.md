# Employment

| **Years** | **Location** | **Title** | **Team/Mentor** | **Description** |
| 2022-Present | University of Utah | Graduate Student | Dr. Sean Howe | Funded by teaching assistantships for undergraduate mathematics courses and research assistantships to study number theory and representation theory. |
|2018--2022 | Google LLC | Software Engineer | Dynamic Search Ads (DSA) | DSA uses advertiser website content to target ads and fill in the gaps of keyword-based campaigns. DSA headlines and landing pages are generated using website content to keep ads relevant and save advertisers' time. My responsibilities were to develop infrastructure, design experiments, and run quality analyses to improve the precision of this automated product. |
| 2015--2018 | Kalamazoo College | MPC Tutor | Dr. Stephen Oloo, Dr. Mckenzie West | Worked in the Math and Physics Center (MPC) to assist students in all undergraduate mathematics and physics courses. |
| 2015--2016 | Kalamazoo College | Research Assistant | Dr. Jan Tobochnik | Optimized Monte Carlo simulations for modelling the phase transition of a colloid. My work entailed optimizing some existing code and adding support for computation of fractal dimension. |
| 2014--2018 | Kalamazoo College | Teaching Assistant | Dr. Dave Wilson, et. al. | Worked with students in physics labs to emphasize inquiry-based approach to physics and develop physical intuition. Also graded assignments for various classes in the mathematics and physics departments. |

# Projects / Schools / Conferences

| **Year** | **Location** | **Title** | **Description** |
| 2024 | Southwest Center for Arithmetic Geometry | Arizona Winter School | Attended AWS 2024 in the study group for Dr. Valentijn Karemaker's work. |
| 2023 | Southwest Center for Arithmetic Geometry | Preliminary Arizona Winter School | Attended the lecture series of Dr. Lassina Dembele, completed exercises, and discussed them in weekly problem sessions. |
| 2022 | Institute for Advanced Study | PCMI Summer School - Number Theory Informed by Computation | Attended the 2022 Park City Mathematics Institute Summer School. Attended lectures, problem sessions, and implemented algorithms for point-counting algorithms, etc. |
| 2017--2018 | Kalamazoo College | Senior Thesis with Dr. Michele Intermont: On a Generalization of the Bestvina-Brady Construction | Studied a functor that assigned a subcomplex of an \\((n+1)\\)-dimensional torus to a given \\(n\\)-dimensional simplicial complex. Investigated the combinatorial properties of this functor, as well as the topological and geometric properties of the toroidal spaces. |
| 2018 | Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM) | Poster Presentation | Presented senior thesis (above) during the student poster presentation. Poster and presentation received Outstanding Poster designation for being in the top 15% of presented topics in topology. |
| 2018 | Kalamazoo College | Mathematics Colloquium | Presented distillation of senior thesis to audience of undergraduate students and professors at Kalamazoo College. |
| 2018--2019 | Mathematical Association of America (MAA) | Journal Solution Submissions | Submitted various solutions to problems posed in the "Problems and Solutions" section of three MAA journals: American Mathematical Monthly, Mathematics Magazine, and College Mathematics Journals. Three such submissions were published as the accepted solution by the curators. |
