Welcome to [my](aboutme.html) site! I use this space to organize my personal and professional life.

I am a queer mathematician, musician, activist, and dancer interested in building community and expanding networks. I subscribe strongly to the axioms of mathematics posited by [&#x21B7;Dr. Federico Ardila](https://fardila.com) and restate them here...

* Axiom 1. Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
* Axiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
* Axiom 3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
* Axiom 4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.

...as well as the statement proceeding these axioms: "These statements should not sound revolutionary, and considering the current practices of the mathematical society, they are a pressing call to action."
