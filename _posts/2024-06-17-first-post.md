I don't know how many times I've tried to start a journal / blog / diary, but here I go again. To keep this from rambling, I'll just explicitly list what I'm hoping to do with this as well as what I'm not.

## Goals

* Reflections after reading (including Radical Reading and Tea Time).
* Updates on daily life (podcasts, teaching, research, workouts, stretches, etc.)
* Longer goals (music playing, music production, choreography, politics, acro, etc.)

## Non-goals

* No formal mathematics here. I do enough of that elsewhere.
* No intended regularity, either in time or in content.

I'll leave it at that for now and add more in following work.
