\begin{proof}
    Suppose that $\sigma_i\tau_j = \sigma_r\tau_s$ pointwise on $M$. Then, each $\tau_a$ fixes $L$ pointwise, so for $\ell \in L$, we have:
    \[ \sigma_i(\ell) = \sigma_i(\tau_j(\ell)) = \sigma_r(\tau_s(\ell)) = \sigma_r(\ell) \]
    So, we must have $i = r$ since $\sigma_i$ and $\sigma_r$ act identically on $L$. In $N$, we can now compose with the automorphism $\sigma_i^{-1}$ to get $\tau_j = \tau_s$ on $M$, which implies $j = s$, as desired.
\end{proof}
