\begin{proof} 
    That this set is a basis is clear from the proof. Now, since $d_1 \mid \cdots \mid d_{k-1}$, we have that $d_{k-1}R_k \subseteq \ZZ[\alpha]$. Conversely, suppose that $mR_k \subseteq \ZZ[\alpha]$. Then, in particular, $\frac{f_{k-1}(\alpha)}{d_{k-1}} \in R_k$, so $\frac{m}{d_{k-1}}f_{k-1}(\alpha) \in \ZZ[\alpha]$. Since $f_{k-1}$ has degree $k-1 < n$, and $\alpha$ is an algebraic integer of degree $n$, we have that the representation given here is unique, i.e. this is an element of $\ZZ[\alpha]$ iff each coefficient is an integer. Finally, $f_{k-1}$ is monic, so the leading coefficient gives $m/d_{k-1} \in \ZZ$, i.e. $d_{k-1} \mid m$, so $m \geq d_{k-1}$.

    This shows that $d_{k-1}$ is the smallest integer with the desired property.
\end{proof}
