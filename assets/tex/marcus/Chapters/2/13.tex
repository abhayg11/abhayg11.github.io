\begin{proof}
    As noted, for a number field $K$ and $\alpha \in \AA \cap K$, $\alpha$ is a unit if and only if $N(\alpha) = \pm 1$. So, let $m \in \ZZ$ be squarefree, negative, and neither of $-1,-3$, and let $K = \QQ(\sqrt{m})$. Now, writing $\alpha = a+b\sqrt{m}$, we have $N(\alpha) = a^2-mb^2$. Since $m < 0$, we have that $a^2-mb^2 \geq 0$, and so if $\alpha$ is a unit, it must have norm $+1$. We now show that $b$ must be zero by casework.

    If $m \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$, then we have $m \leq -7$ since we've excluded the case $m=-3$. We also have $a,b \in \frac12\ZZ$ in this case. If $b \neq 0$, then we have $b^2 \geq \frac14$, and so $a^2-mb^2 \geq 0+\frac74 > 1$, contrary to assumption. So $b=0$ in this case.

    Otherwise, $m \equiv 2,3 \pmod{4}$, so $m \leq -2$ and $a,b \in \ZZ$. Then, if $b \neq 0$ we have $a^2-mb^2 \geq 2 \cdot 1 > 1$, again contrary to assumption.

    So, in either case we have $b=0$. Then we need $a^2 = 1$, and so $a = \pm 1$ which gives that $\alpha = \pm 1$ are the only possible units. It is also clear that they are both units. \\

    For the case $m=-1$, we have $\AA \cap \QQ[i] = \ZZ[i]$ and we've seen that the units are precisely $\pm 1, \pm i$. For the case $m=-3$, we have $\AA \cap QQ[\sqrt{-3}] = \ZZ[\omega]$ for $\omega$ a primitive cube root of unity. Then the units are $\pm 1, \pm \omega, \pm \omega^2$.
\end{proof}
