\begin{proof} 
    Since each $g_j(\alpha)/d_j$ is an algebraic integer and the set $\{f_i(\alpha)/d_i\}$ is an integral basis, there is an integer matrix $A$ such that
    \[ g_j(\alpha)/d_j = \sum_i A_{ij}f_i(\alpha)/d_i \]
    It suffices to show $\det A = 1$. But since $g_j$ is monic of degree $j$, $f_i$ is monic of degree $i$, and $i,j < n$ are all less than the degree of $\alpha$, we get that $A$ must be upper triangular with each diagonal element equal to 1. So, $\det A = 1$ as claimed.
\end{proof}
