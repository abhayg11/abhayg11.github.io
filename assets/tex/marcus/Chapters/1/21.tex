\begin{proof}
    Note that $f(t)(t-1) = t^p-1$. Then $f(\omega)(\omega-1) = \omega^p-1 = 0$, so $f(\omega) = 0$, since $\omega \neq 1$. So, $\omega$ has degree at most $p-1$, and to see that it has degree $p-1$ exactly, we check that $f$ is irreducible.

    But
    \[ f(t+1)t = (t+1)^p-1 = t^p + {p \choose 1}t^{p-1} + \cdots + {p \choose p-1}t + 1 - 1 \]
    So, subtracting and dividing by $t$ gives:
    \[ f(t+1) = t^{p-1} + {p \choose 1}t^{p-2} + \cdots + {p \choose p-1} \]
    By Eisenstein's criterion, this is irreducible as long as $p$ divides ${p \choose k}$ for $k=1,\ldots,p-1$ and $p^2 \nmid {p \choose p-1}$. The first is clear, since ${p \choose k} = \frac{p!}{k!(p-k)!}$ and $p$ divides the numerator but not the denominator. The second is also clear, since ${p \choose p-1} = p$.
\end{proof}
