\begin{proof}
    By the previous problem, if $\alpha \in Z[i]$ is a unit, then $\alpha \mid 1$ and so $N(\alpha)$ divides $N(1) = 1^2+0^2 = 1$. But $N(\alpha)$ is a nonnegative integer, so we must have $N(\alpha) = 1$. Conversely, if $\alpha \in Z[i]$ has $N(\alpha) = 1$, then $\alpha\overline{\alpha} = 1$, and $\overline{\alpha} \in Z[i]$ as well, so $\alpha$ is a unit (with inverse $\overline{\alpha}$).
    
    Hence, to categorize units, we need to solve $a^2+b^2 = 1$ for $a,b \in \ZZ$. The only solutions are $(a,b) = (\pm 1,0)$ and $(a,b) = (0,\pm 1)$, corresponding to $\alpha = a+bi \in \{1,-1,i,-i\}$.
