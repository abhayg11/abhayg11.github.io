\begin{proof}
    This proof also works the same way. Writing $P$ as the set of prime ideal factors of $(x+y\omega)$, each $\pi$ contains $z$, and the factorization of $(z)$ includes $\pi^n$ as a multiplicand for some $n$. Then $(x+y\omega) = I^p$ where $I$ is the product of $\pi^n$ over all $\pi$.
