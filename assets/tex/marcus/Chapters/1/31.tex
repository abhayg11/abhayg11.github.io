\begin{proof}
    Note that this is false unless we assume $\alpha \neq 0$. With this assumption, now assume that $\alpha A = \beta R$. Then in particular, there is $a \in A$ with $\alpha a = \beta$. I claim $A = aR$. One containment is obvious, and for the other, suppose $x \in A$. Then $\alpha x \in \beta R$ so there is $r \in R$ with $\alpha x = \beta r = \alpha ar$. Since $\alpha$ is nonzero and $R$ is a domain, we get $x = ar \in aR$ as claimed.

    So, indeed, the principal ideals form an ideal class. For any two principal ideals are clearly in the same class, and the previous argument shows that if $A$ is in the same class as a principal ideal, then it is itself principal.
