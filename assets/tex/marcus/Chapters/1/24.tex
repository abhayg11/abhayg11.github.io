\begin{proof}
    Note that:
    \[ (\beta+\gamma)^p - (\beta^p+\gamma^p) = {p \choose 1}\beta\gamma^{p-1} + \cdots + {p \choose p-1}\beta^{p-1}\gamma \]
    and the right hand side is divisible by $p$ since each binomial coefficient is. By induction, we have
    \[ \left(\sum_{i=1}^n \beta_i\right)^p \equiv \sum_{i=1}^n \beta_i^p \]
    since the above gives the case $n=2$ and each additional term also follows from the above case.
\end{proof}
