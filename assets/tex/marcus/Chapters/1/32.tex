\begin{proof}
    Suppose that multiplication of ideal classes forms a group. Since $R \cdot R = R$, we have that principal ideals must be the identity element of this group. Hence, if $A$ is any ideal, then the ideal class of $A$ has an inverse, i.e. another class such that the product of the representatives gives a representative of the identity. I.e. we get an ideal $B$ such that $AB$ is principal as desired.

    Conversely, suppose that every ideal has an inverse in this sense. Then multiplication of ideal classes is associative and the principal ideals act as identity clearly, and the inverse condition is satisfied by our assumption.
