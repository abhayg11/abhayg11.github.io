\begin{proof}
    Suppose that $\pi$ also divides $x+y\omega^i$ for some $i = 2,\ldots,p$. Then $\pi$ divides the difference: $(x+y\omega^i) - (x+y\omega) = y\omega(\omega^{i-1}-1)$. Multiplying through by the remaining factors of the form $\omega^j-1$ and by $\omega^{p-1}$ gives that $\pi$ divides $yp$. On the other hand, $\pi$ divides $z^p$ and so $\pi$ divides $z$ since it's prime. Since $p$ does not divide $z$, we have that $z$ and $yp$ are coprime, so we cannot have a common divisor $\pi$.
