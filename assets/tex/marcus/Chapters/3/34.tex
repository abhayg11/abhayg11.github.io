\begin{proof}
	More generally, we know that nondegenerate bilinear forms on finite-dimensional vector space have dual bases. Define the inner product $\left<\cdot,\cdot\right> : L \times L \to K$ by $\left<a,b\right> = T(ab)$. Linearity of the trace shows that this is bilinear, and the fact that $T(x) = 0 \implies x = 0$ gives nondegeneracy. Hence with respect to the basis $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n$, $\left<\cdot,\cdot\right>$ has a dual basis $\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_n$. Thus, $T(\alpha_i\beta_j) = \left<\alpha_i,\beta_j\right> = \delta_{ij}$, which is what we sought.
