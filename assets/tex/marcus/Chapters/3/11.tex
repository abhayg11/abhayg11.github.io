\begin{proof}
	Let $\alpha \in I$. Then $\alpha R \subseteq I$, so $I \mid \alpha R$, so there is some nonzero ideal $J$ with $\alpha R = IJ$. Then
	\[ \|I\| \|J\| = \|IJ\| = \|\alpha R\| = N^K(\alpha) \]
	so that $\|I\| \mid N^K(\alpha)$ as claimed. If these are equal, then $[R:J] = \|J\| = 1$, so $J = R$. Then $\alpha R = IJ = IR = I$ as claimed. Conversely, if $\alpha R = I$, then clearly the two ideals have the same norm.
\end{proof}
