\begin{proof}
	Let $G$ be generated (freely) by $e_1,\ldots,e_n \in G$. Then $G/mG$ is generated by the images $e_i + mG$. Each has order $m$ since $me_i \in mG$, and there are no further relations. For if
	\[ \sum_{i=1}^n a_i(e_i+mG) = mG \]
	then $\sum a_ie_i \in mG$, and since these generate freely, each $a_i$ must be a multiple of $m$. So, the sum is already zero. I.e. $G/mG$ is isomorphic to $(\ZZ/m\ZZ)^n$ as claimed.
\end{proof}
