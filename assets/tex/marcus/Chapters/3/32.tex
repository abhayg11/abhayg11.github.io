\begin{proof}
	Since $J$ is a fractional ideal, we can write it as $\alpha H$ for some ideal $H$ of $R$ and some $\alpha \in K^\times$. Then,
	\[ J/(IJ) = (\alpha H)/(\alpha IH) \cong H/(IH) \]
	via the multiplication by $\alpha,\alpha^{-1}$ maps. But then,
	\[ |J/(IJ)| = |H/(IH)| = |(R/(IH))/(R/H)| = \frac{|R/(IH)|}{|R/H|} = \frac{\|IH\|}{\|H\|} = \frac{\|I\|\|H\|}{\|H\|} = \|I\| = |R/I| \]
	as claimed.
\end{proof}
