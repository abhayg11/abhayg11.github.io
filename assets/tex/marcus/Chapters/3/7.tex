\begin{proof}
	If $I+J = R$, then there is $a \in I$, $b \in J$ with $a+b = 1$. Then, by the binomial theorem,
	\[ 1 = 1^{n+m} = (a+b)^{n+m} = \sum_{i=0}^{n+m} {n+m \choose i}a^ib^{n+m-i} \]
	Each summand is either divisible by $a^m$ and so is in $I^m$ or else is divisible by $b^n$ and so is in $J^n$. So we have $I^m + J^n = R$ as claimed.
\end{proof}
