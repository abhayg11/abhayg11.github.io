\begin{proof}
	The two remaining claims in the proof of [Lemma 2, Theorem 15] are that $\gamma \in K \setminus R$ and $\gamma A \subseteq R$. The first is clear, for if $\gamma \in R$, then $b = a\gamma \in (a)$, contrary to assumption. For the second, note that $b \in P_2 \cdots P_r$ and $A \subseteq P = P_1$. Hence $bA \subseteq P_1 \cdots P_r \subseteq aR$. So, $\gamma A \subseteq R$ as claimed.
\end{proof}
