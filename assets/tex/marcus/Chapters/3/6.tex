\begin{proof} The only two gaps in the proof are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $A$ is an ideal since it is clearly an $R$-submodule of $K$ contained in $R$.
\item $\gamma J \subseteq J$, since for $\beta \in J$, we have $\gamma\beta \in \gamma J \subseteq R$ and 
	\[ \gamma\beta I \subseteq \gamma IJ = \gamma\alpha A \subseteq \alpha R \]
	so that $\gamma\beta \in J$ by definition.
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
