\begin{proof}
	I drop the bars for convenience. Let $A$ be a maximal isotropic subgroup of $H/Z$. To show that it is polarizing, suppose that $x \in H/Z$ is such that $\left<x,y\right> = 1$ for all $y \in A$. We seek to show $x \in A$. Consider the subgroup $B = A\left<x\right> \subseteq H/Z$. Since $A \subseteq B$, it suffices to show that $B$ is isotropic, for then $B = A$ by maximality of $A$.
	
	Note that any element of $B$ is of the form $ax^n$ for $a \in A$ and $n \in \ZZ$. Then,
	\[ \left<ax^n,bx^m\right> = \left<a,b\right>\left<a,x^m\right>\left<x^n,b\right>\left<x^n,x^m\right> = \left<a,x\right>^m\left<x,b\right>^n = (1^{-1})^m(1)^n = 1 \]
	and so $B$ is indeed isotropic.
\end{proof}
