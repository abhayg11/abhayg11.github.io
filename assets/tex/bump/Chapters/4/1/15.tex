\begin{proof}
	Note that in problem \#13 above, all of the equalities were computed over $PGL$, but the only time scaling was used was in the last two, in which the ignored factor was $\chi(-1)^{\dim(V)}\epsilon^2$. But the previous exercise shows that the suggested choice of $\epsilon$ makes this factor exactly 1.
\end{proof}
