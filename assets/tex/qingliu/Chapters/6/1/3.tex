\mtexe{6.1.3}
\begin{proof}
	This follows from the parallel fact on rings. Namely, for $\beta \in \widehat{B}$, there is some $b \in B$ with $\beta - b \in I\widehat{B}$, so that $d\beta \in db + d\left(I\widehat{B}\right) \subseteq \rho(\Omega^1_{B/A})+I\Omega^1_{\widehat{B}/A}$. This same decomposition shows that the left-hand side here is also a $\widehat{B}$-module (despite the first summand being only a $B$-module), and since we've just shown it contains a collection of $\widehat{B}$-module generators of the right hand side, they must be equal.
