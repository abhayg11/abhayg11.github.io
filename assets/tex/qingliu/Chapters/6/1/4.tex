\begin{proof}
	Note that locally, $Y \to Z$ arises either as a ring localization or quotient, and so $\Omega^1_{Y/Z} = 0$. Hence, the isomorphism follows from the exact sequence
	\[ f^\ast\Omega^1_{Y/Z} \to \Omega^1_{X/Z} \to \Omega^1_{X/Y} \to 0 \]
	of sheaves on $X$, with $f : X \to Y$.
\end{proof}
