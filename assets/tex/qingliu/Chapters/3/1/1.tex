\begin{proof}
	Define $(f,g) : Z \to X \times_S Y$ by $(f,g)(z) = (f(z),g(z))$. To see that this is actually an element of $X \times_S Y$ (and not just $X \times Y$), note that $\phi(f(z)) = (\phi \circ f)(z) = (\psi \circ g)(z) = \psi(g(z))$ as needed. Further, this map satisfies the desired condition since:
	\[ (p \circ (f,g))(z) = p(f(z),g(z)) = f(z) \text{ and } (q \circ (f,g))(z) = q(f(z),g(z)) = g(z) \]
	for all $z \in Z$. The uniqueness of $(f,g)$ is obvious.
\end{proof}
