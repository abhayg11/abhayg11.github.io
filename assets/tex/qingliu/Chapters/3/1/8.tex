\mtexe{3.1.8}
\begin{proof}
	Let $f : X \to S$ be surjective and $g : Y \to S$ be any morphism. We wish to show that $q : X \times_S Y \to Y$ surjects, so let $y \in Y$. Then, let $s = g(y)$, and since $f$ is surjective, pick any $x$ such that $f(x) = s$. Then, by the previous exercise, we have a homeomorphism
	\[ \Spec(k(x) \otimes_{k(s)} k(y)) \to \{ z \in X \times_S Y : p(z) = x, q(z) = y \} \]
	In particular, the former is nonempty, so the latter is nonempty, giving $z \in X \times_S Y$ such that $q(z) = y$ as desired.
\end{proof}
