\mtexe{3.3.18}
\begin{proof}
	This is immediate from the two cited exercises. Namely, we have the maps $\Spec\scO_K \to X \to \Spec\ZZ$. The composition is finite, so proper. By assumption, the first map is an open immersion and the second map is separated. Finally, $X$ is connected. So, by exercise 3.3.5, the first map is an isomorphism. But an inclusion of schemes being an isomorphism means it is actually an equality.
\end{proof}
