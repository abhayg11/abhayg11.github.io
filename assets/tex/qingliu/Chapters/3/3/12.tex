\begin{proof}
	Write $X = A \cup B$ as the union of two nonempty closed subsets. We wish to show that they cannot be disjoint. Since $f$ is proper, it is closed, so $f(A)$ and $f(B)$ are nonempty closed subsets of $Y$. Since $f$ is surjective, we get $f(A) \cup f(B) = f(A \cup B) = f(X) = Y$. Since $Y$ is connected, we conclude that $f(A) \cap f(B) \neq \emptyset$, so choose $y \in f(A) \cap f(B)$. Then
	\[ X_y = X \cap X_y = (A \cup B) \cap X_y = (A \cap X_y) \cup (B \cap X_y) \]
	writes $X_y$ as the union of two closed subsets, and the condition $y \in f(A) \cap f(B)$ means that both are nonempty. Since $X_y$ is connected, we get that $(A \cap X_y) \cap (B \cap X_y) \neq \emptyset$ and so $A \cap B \neq \emptyset$ in particular, as we wished to show. \\
	
	Note that $Y = \Spec k[T_1]$ is connected and $X = \Spec k[T_1,T_2]/(T_1(T_1T_2-1))$ is disconnected. It is also the case that $f$ is surjective. Indeed, choose a prime ideal $\frp \in \Spec k[T_1]$ and note that it is principal, generated by some irreducible $g$. If $T_1 \in \frp$, then $\frp k[T_1,T_2] = gk[T_1,T_2]$ is a prime ideal since $g$ remains irreducible in the overring, and it contains $T_1(T_1T_2-1)$, so it corresponds to a point $x \in X$. Then $f(x) = k[T_1] \cap gk[T_1,T_2] = gk[T_1] = \frp$ as desired. Otherwise $T_1 \notin \frp$, so $\frp k[T_1,T_1^{-1}]$ is a prime ideal of the localization $k[T_1]_{T_1} = k[T_1,T_1^{-1}] \cong k[T_1,T_2]/(T_1T_2-1)$. So, again, it corresponds to a point $x \in X$ with $f(x) = \frp$.
	
	This indeed provides the desired counterexample, then, as long as we can show that the fibers are connected. The fiber over $(T_1)$ consists of those primes $\frq$ of $k[T_1,T_2]/(T_1(T_1T_2-1))$ that contract to $(T_1)$. In particular, $T_1 \in \frq$, so $\frq$ corresponds to a prime of $k[T_1,T_2]/(T_1,T_1(T_1T_2-1)) \cong k[T_2]$ and any such prime works, so the fiber $\Spec k[T_2]$ is connected. The fiber over $\frp$ for any other prime consists of primes $\frq$ that contract to $\frp$, which means that $\frq$ is a prime of $k[T_1,T_2]$ that contains $T_1(T_1T_2-1)$ but does not, in particular, contain $T_1$, so $T_1T_2-1 \in \frq$, so $\frq$ corresponds to a prime of $k[T_1,T_2]/(T_1T_2-1) \cong k[T_1]_{T_1}$. But now the map $k[T_1] \to k[T_1]_{T_1}$ is a localization, so we get a bijection between primes of the latter and primes of the former not containing $T_1$. So, each fiber is a singleton and certainly connected.
