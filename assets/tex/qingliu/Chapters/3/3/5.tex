\begin{proof}
	Since the composition $X \xrightarrow{f} Y \to S$ is proper and $Y \to S$ is separated, $f$ itself is proper. But then $f$ is an open immersion and also (universally) closed, so $f(X)$ is a clopen subset of $Y$. Since $Y$ is connected, $f(X) = Y$ and so $f$ is a surjective open immersion, and so an isomorphism.
\end{proof}
