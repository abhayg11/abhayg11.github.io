\begin{proof}
	Recall that we can compute preimages via fiber products, so $f^{-1}(V) \cong V \times_Y X$ along the inclusion $V \hookrigharrow V$ and $f : X \to Y$. But since $Y$ is separated, we get that $V \times_Y X \to V \times_\ZZ X$ is a closed immersion. But since $V,X,\Spec\ZZ$ are all affine, so is the fiber product, and so we've shown that $f^{-1}(V)$ is a closed subscheme of an affine scheme, which is just $\Spec$ of the relevant quotient ring, and thus also affine.
\end{proof}
