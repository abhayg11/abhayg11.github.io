\begin{proof}
	Note that $Y$ has an open cover $\{\Spec A_i\}$ of finitely many affine schemes corresponding to Noetherian rings. Since $X \to Y$ is of finite type, each preimage of a $\Spec A_i$ is covered by finitely many affine opens corresponding to a finitely generated $A_i$-algebra. But a finitely generated algebra over a Noetherian ring is Noetherian, and the finite union of finite sets is finite, so we've covered $X$ by finitely many Noetherian affine open subschemes, showing that $X$ is Noetherian.
	
	Since dimensions can be computed locally, the dimension of $X$ is the supremum of the dimensions of each of the affine schemes in the above cover. But each one of these is finite, bounded by the dimension of $A_i$ plus the number of generators, and there are only finitely many of them, so the supremum is also finite.
\end{proof}
