\begin{proof}
	Let $\mcP$ be one of the properties `reduced,' `irreducible,' `integral,' or `connected.' Suppose that we know that if $X$ is a geometrically $\mcP$ $F$-variety, then $X_L$ is $\mcP$ whenever $F$ is algebraically closed and $L/F$ is finitely generated. Now, let $X$ be a geometrically $\mcP$ $k$-variety and $K/k$ be any extension. Pick a transcendence basis $S$ for $K/k$, so that $K$ is an algebraic extension of $k(S)$. 
\end{proof}
