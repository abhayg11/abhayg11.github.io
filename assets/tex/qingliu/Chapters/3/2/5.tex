\begin{proof}
	As above, this result follows from the affine case and gluing. In the affine case, we have a Noetherian ring $R$, a prime ideal $\frp$, finitely generated $R$-algebras $A$ and $B$, and a map $\varphi_0 : A_\frp \to B_\frp$. We seek $f \notin \frp$ such that there is a map $\varphi : A_f \to B_f$ factoring $\varphi_0$.
\end{proof}
