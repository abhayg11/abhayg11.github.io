\begin{proof}
	Let $i : U \to X$ be the inclusion map, so that we wish to show $i^\# : A \to B$ is flat. It suffices to show this locally. That is, for $\frq \in \Spec B = U$ and $\frp = i(\frq) \in \Spec A$, we wish to show that $A_\frp \to B_\frq$ is flat. But this is the map $i^\#_\frq : U_\frq \to X_{i(\frq)}$, which is an isomorphism since $U$ is an open subscheme. Isomorphisms are clearly flat, so the claim is shown.
\end{proof}
