\begin{proof}
	One direction is trivial. If every affine open subscheme of $X$ is Noetherian, then given a point of $X$, pick any of its affine open neighborhoods; by assumption this is Noetherian, and so $X$ is locally Noetherian. Now suppose that $X$ is locally Noetherian, and let $U = \Spec A$ be an affine open subscheme. Since $X$ is locally Noetherian, each $x \in U$ has a Noetherian neighborhood of $X$. Since open subschemes of Noetherian schemes are Noetherian, we may further assume that each $x$ has an open Noetherian neighborhood of $U$. But affine schemes are quasi-compact, so we can cover $U$ by finitely of these, and hence $U$ is Noetherian, as claimed.
