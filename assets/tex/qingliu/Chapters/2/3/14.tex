\mtexe{2.3.14} 
\begin{proof}
	Note that we've already seen that affine schemes are quasi-compact (exercise 2.1.6). A topological space that is the finite union of quasi-compact subspaces is itself clearly quasi-compact, so one direction is complete: a scheme that is a finite union of affine schemes is quasi-compact. Conversely, suppose $X$ is a quasi-compact scheme. By definition, $X$ has an open covering by affine schemes, and by quasi-compactness, this can be reduced to a finite subcover. So, the claim is shown.
\end{proof}
