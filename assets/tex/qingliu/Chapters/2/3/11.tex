\mtexe{2.3.11} 
\begin{proof}
	Note that $C$ is a subring of $B$, so the inclusion induces a map $i : \Spec B \to \Spec C$. I claim that this restricts to a map $\Proj B \to \Proj C$. Note that if $P \in \Proj B$, then it is a homogeneous prime ideal and $i(P) = P \cap C$ is also homogeneous, for if $f \in P \cap C$, then each nonzero homogeneous component of $f$ must have degree divisible by $e$ by virtue of $f$ being in $C$, and each such component is therefore in $P \cap C$ as well.
	
	We would now like to also demonstrate that $P \cap C$ does not contain $C_{+}$.
\end{proof}
