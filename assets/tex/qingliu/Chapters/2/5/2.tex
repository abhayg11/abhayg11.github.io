\begin{proof}
	Note that $\overline{\{x\}}$ is irreducible and closed in $X$. So, the codimension is the supremum of lengths of strictly ascending chains of irreducible closed subsets between $\overline{\{x\}}$ and $X$. Choose an open affine $U = \Spec A$ containing $x$. Then we have a bijection between such chains and chains of irreducible closed subsets of $U$ containing $x$, given by taking intersections with $U$ for one direction and taking closures in $X$ for the other.
	
	So, considering $x$ as a prime ideal in $A$, we are considering chains of irreducibles in $U$ containing $x$, which is precisely chains of primes in $A$ contained in $x$, which is precisely chains of primes in $A_x = \scO_{X,x}$. So, the codimension is exactly $\dim(\scO_{X,x})$.
\end{proof}
