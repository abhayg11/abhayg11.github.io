\begin{proof}
	Note that the homogenization of $\frp$ is prime, contained in $\frp$, and contains $f$, so by minimality, $\frp$ is homogeneous. Similarly, $\frp \cap B_{+}$ is prime and contains $f$, so $\frp \cap B_{+} = \frp$, whence $\frp \subseteq B_{+}$. Finally, since $X$ is a variety over $k$, $B$ is a finitely generated $k$-algebra, and so is Noetherian, whence $\height\frp \leq 1$. If $V_{+}(f) = \emptyset$, then $\frp \notin V_{+}(f)$, so $\frp \supseteq B_{+}$, i.e. $\frp = B_{+}$. Further, we have
	\[ \dim(X) = \dim(\Proj B) = \dim(B)-1 = \height(\frp)+\dim(B/\frp)-1 \leq 1-1+\dim(k) = 0 \]
	as claimed. \\
