\begin{proof}
	Note that $\Spec\scO_K = \{(0),(t)\}$ and that $\Spec A = \{(0) \times k, K \times (0) \}$. Then, in fact, $f_\varphi$ is a bijection since $\phi^{-1}((0) \times k) = (0)$ and $\phi^{-1}(K \times (0)) = (t)$. However, the two primes in $\scO_K$ form a chain, while the two primes of $A$ are incomparable, so $\dim\scO_K = 1$ and $\dim A = 0$. Finally, $A$ is a finitely generated $\scO_K$-algebra since both $K = \scO_K[x]/(tx-1)$ and $k = \scO_K/(t)$ are.
\end{proof}
