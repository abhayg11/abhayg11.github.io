\begin{proof}
	Let $\frm \in \Spec(B)$ be a closed point, i.e. a maximal ideal of $B$. Then we can take the composition:
	\[ A \xrightarrow{\varphi} B \to B/\frm \]
	Then $B/\frm$ is a finitely generated $k$-algebra and a field, so it's a finite field extension (Zariski Lemma). So, each element of $A$ maps to an algebraic element over $k$. I.e. the image of $A$ in $B/\frm$ is a finitely generated $k$-algebra that is algebraic over $k$. Thus, it must be a field, so $A/\varphi^{-1}(\frm)$ is a field, whence $\varphi^{-1}(\frm)$ is maximal. So, $(\Spec\varphi)(\frm) = \varphi^{-1}(\frm)$ is a closed point.
\end{proof}
