\begin{proof}
	It suffices to describe the irreducible closed subsets of $\Spec\ZZ[T]$, which are of the form $V(P)$ for $P \in \Spec\ZZ[T]$. Indeed, any closed set is then a finite union of these irreducible closed sets. We will organize this by $\height P$:
	
	The only height zero prime is $(0)$, and $V(0) = \AA_\ZZ^1$ is the whole space.
	
	The height one primes are of the form $(f)$ where $f \in \ZZ[T]$ is irreducible (over $\QQ$, say), or of the form $(p)$ for $p$ a rational prime. I'm not sure what to say (geometrically) about $V(f)$, but note that $V(p) = \AA_{\FF_p}^1$.
	
	Finally, the height two primes are of the form $(f,p)$ for $p$ a prime and $f$ irreducible when reduced mod $p$ (i.e. over $\FF_p$). These are the closed points $V(f,p)$.
\end{proof}
