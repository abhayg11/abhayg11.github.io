\begin{proof}
	Let $A = \{ x \in X : s_x = t_x \}$. Suppose that $x \in A$. Then there is an open neighborhood $U$ of $x$ with $s|_U = t|_U$. But then for any $y \in U$, we have
	\[ s_y = (s|_U)_y = (t|_U)_y = t_y \]
	so $y \in A$. Thus $U \subseteq A$ and we've shown that each $x \in A$ is contained in an open set contained in $A$, so $A$ is open as claimed.
\end{proof}
