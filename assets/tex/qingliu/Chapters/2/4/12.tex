\begin{proof}
	Let $Y$ be a reduced closed subscheme of $\Proj B$. As a set, $Y$ is closed, so it is of the form $V_{+}(I)$ for some homogeneous ideal $I$ of $B$. Without loss of generality, we may assume $I$ is radical, since $\sqrt{I}$ is also homogeneous and $V_{+}(\sqrt{I}) = V_{+}(I)$.
	
	Now, note that the map $B \to B/I$ induces a closed immersion $\Proj(B/I) \to \Proj(B)$ since the map respects the irrelevant ideals. But then $\Proj(B/I)$ is a reduced closed subscheme of $\Proj(B)$ that has the same underlying set as $Y$. By uniqueness, $Y = \Proj(B/I)$.
\end{proof}
