\mtexe{4.3.1}
\begin{proof}
	We can directly identify the local ring of the fiber to be $\scO_{X,x} \otimes_{\scO_{S,s}} k(s) = \scO_{X,x}/t\scO_{X,x}$. But now the problem is complete by corollary 4.2.12: $\scO_{X,x}$ is regular if and only if $t \in \frm_x \setminus \frm_x^2$. [Something must be wrong here, as I haven't used flatness, finite type, $s$ being closed, or $S$ being Dedekind at all, although the existence of $t$ does follow from these last two facts].
\end{proof}
