\begin{proof}
	Note that since $X$ is proper over $\Spec k$, $\scO_X(X)$ is integral over $k$, so it is contained in $k'$, the integral closure of $k$ in $K(X)$. But since $X$ is normal, $\scO_X(X)$ is also integrally closed in $K(X)$, so it contains $k'$. I.e. $\scO_X(X) = k'$ as claimed.
\end{proof}
