\mtexe{4.1.11}
\begin{proof}
	That $X'$ is a $k'$-scheme is immediate by gluing. Indeed, if $A$ is a finitely generated $k$-algebra with field of fractions $K$, then the integral closure $A'$ of $A$ in $K$ contains the algebraic closure $k'$ of $k$ in $K$, which is what we needed to show. Then, since the composition $X' \to \Spec k' \to \Spec k$ is of finite type (Proposition 4.1.27) and the first map is quasi-compact, the first map must be of finite type, as we wished to show. \\
	
	This is also immediate from the above description, since we have $k' \to A' \to A'_\frm \to A'_\frm/\frm A'_\frm = k(x)$, where $\frm$ is the prime ideal corresponding to $x$, showing that $k'$ is (canonically) a subfield of $k(x)$. The fact that $k'/k$ is finite is also straightforward: $K(X)/k$ is a finitely generated extension, so $k'/k$ is also, and $k'/k$ is also clearly algebraic, whence $k'/k$ is finite.
\end{proof}
