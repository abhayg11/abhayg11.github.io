\begin{proof}
	Since the extension is faithfully flat, we have
	\[ I = IB \cap A \subseteq JB \cap A = J \]
	so we're done. \\
	
	Since $f \in A$ is integral over $A$, its image in $\Frac(B)$ is integral over $B$. Indeed, the integral relation maps to another integral relation. So, the image is actually in $B$ itself by normality, so that $aB \subseteq bB$. By the above, $aA \subseteq bA$, and in particular, $a \in bA$, so there is some $g \in A$ with $a = bg$. But then $f = ab^{-1} = bgb^{-1} = g \in A$, showing that $A$ is also normal.
\end{proof}
