\begin{proof}
	Note that if $x$ is a generic point of $X$, then $\scO_{X,x}$ is a reduced, local, zero-dimensional ring, and so must be a field. But then it is obviously integrally closed in its field of fractions (itself), so $X$ is normal at $x$. For each such generic point, we may choose an open neighborhood around it, and since there are only finitely many irreducible components, we may choose these neighborhoods to be fully contained in just one irreducible component; i.e. we may choose them to themselves be irreducible. Finally, note that each of these neighborhoods is an open subscheme, and so is also reduced, and we have chosen for it to be irreducible, so each is integral. Hence, for each, the set of normal points is open. Let $U$ be the union of the normal points from each of these neighborhoods. Then $U$ is open, normal, and contains each generic point of $X$, so is dense, as desired.
