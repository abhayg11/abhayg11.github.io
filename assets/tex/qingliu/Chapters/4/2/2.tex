\begin{proof}
	We can see that $X = \Spec k[x,y,z]/(x^2-yz)$ is singular quickly from the Jacobian criterion:
	\[ J = (2x, -z, -y) \]
	which is zero at $(0,0,0)$, while at regular points it would have rank $3-\dim\scO_{X,x} = 3-2 = 1$. Furthermore, at all other points, $J$ does have rank 1, so these points are regular and normal.
	
	Thus, it remains only to show that $X$ is normal at the origin. In other words, we need to show that $k[x,y,z,1/x,1/y,1/z]/(x^2-yz)$ is integrally closed in its field of fractions. But we can identify
	\[ k[x,y,z,1/x,1/y,1/z]/(x^2-yz) \cong k[x,y,x^2/y,1/x,1/y,y/x^2] = k[x,y,1/x,1/y] = k[x,y]_{xy} \]
	as a localization of a polynomial ring. So, it is indeed normal.
\end{proof}
