\begin{proof}
	We can see that $X = \Spec R$ where $R = k[x,y,z]/(x^2-yz)$ is singular quickly from the Jacobian criterion:
	\[ J = (2x, -z, -y) \]
	which is zero at $(0,0,0)$, while at regular points it would have rank $3-\dim\scO_{X,x} = 3-2 = 1$.
	
	Now, we would like to show $R$ is normal. Note that $R_y = k[x,y,z,1/y]/(x^2-yz) \cong k[x,y,1/y] = k[x,y]_y$ via $z \mapsto x^2/y$ is normal as the localization of a polynomial ring, and $R_z$ is normal for a symmetric reason. We would be done if $R = R_y \cap R_z$ (the intersection taking place in, say, $\Frac(R)$). First, note that elements of $R$ can be represented by $xf(y,z)+g(y,z)$ after division by $x^2-yz$. Further, $f,g \in k[y,z]$ are uniquely determined by the element of $R$, since the map $k[x,y,z] \to k[t,s]$ with $x \mapsto ts$, $y \mapsto t^2$, and $z \mapsto s^2$ factors through $R$, and maps this element to $tsf(t^2,s^2)+g(t^2,s^2)$, which is zero iff $f = g = 0$, as the first summand only contains odd degree terms while the second contains only even ones.
	
	So, now suppose $(xf_1(y,z)+g_1(y,z))/y^n = (xf_2(y,z)+g_2(y,z))/z^m$ is in $R_y \cap R_z$. Then $xz^mf_1(y,z)+z^mg_1(y,z) = xy^nf_2(y,z)+y^ng_2(y,z)$. By the uniqueness above, $z^mf_1(y,z) = y^nf_2(y,z)$ and $z^mg_1(y,z) = y^ng_2(y,z)$ in $k[y,z]$, so $y^n \mid f_1,g_1$. Hence $(xf_1(y,z)+g_1(y,z))/y^n \in R$ as desired.
\end{proof}
