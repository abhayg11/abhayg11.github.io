\begin{proof}
	It is clear that $f\scO_X$ is finitely generated. Namely, on the open cover $\{X\}$ itself, we have the surjection
	\[ \scO_X^1 \xrightarrow{f} f\scO_X \]
	It is also clear that $f\scO_X$ is quasicoherent, for on an open affine $U = \Spec A$ with open subset $V$, we have
	\[ \widetilde{(f\scO_X)(U)}(V) = \widetilde{fA}(V) = f\scO_U(V) = f\scO_X(V) \]
	so $\widetilde{f\scO_X(U)} = (f\scO_X)|_U$.
	
	Finally, it is not in general invertible. For example, consider $X = \Spec k[x,y]/(xy)$ and let $f = x \in \scO_X(X)$. Then, if we had an isomorphism (of modules) $\scO_X|_U \cong f\scO_X|_U$ for any open subset containing the point associated to the prime ideal $(x)$, then we would also get an isomorphism at the stalks, which is $(k[x,y]/(xy))_{(x)} = k$ and $(xk[x,y]/(xy))_{(x)} = 0$.
