\begin{proof}
	Recall that localization is exact. We have the exact sequence of $A$-modules:
	\[ 0 \to \frp \to A \to A/\frp \to 0 \]
	and we can localize it at $\frp$ to get:
	\[ 0 \to \frp A_\frp \to A_\frp \to (A/\frp)_\frp \to 0 \]
	On the other hand, we can recognize that $\frp$ corresponds to the ideal 0 in $A/\frp$, and so this final localization is the field of fractions. I.e. we have
	\[ 0 \to \frp A_\frp \to A_\frp \to \Frac(A/\frp) \to 0 \]
	which is what we sought to show.
\end{proof}
