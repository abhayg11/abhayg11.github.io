\begin{proof}
	The statement is false. Let $u = \sqrt{2}-1$. Note that $u$ is an algebraic integer of degree 2, since $u^2+2u-1 = 0$. Hence, all powers of $u$ are algebraic integers of degree at most 2. However, $|u| = u < 1$, so $|u^n| < 1$ for all $n \geq 1$, and all of these powers are distinct (again since $|u| < 1$). So, we have shown that there are infintely many algebraic integers in $\CC$ of bounded degree and magnitude.
