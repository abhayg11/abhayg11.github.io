\begin{proof}
	Consider $\alpha = \frac{4+\sqrt{7}}{3} \in \QQ(\sqrt{7})$. Note that
	\[ N(\alpha) = \frac{4+\sqrt{7}}{3} \cdot \frac{4-\sqrt{7}}{3} = \frac{16-7}{9} = 1 \]
	But $\alpha \notin \scO_{\QQ(\sqrt{7})} = \ZZ[\sqrt{7}]$. \\
	
	Alternatively, let $\alpha$ be a root of $f(x) = x^3 + \frac{1}{2}x + 1$. This has no rational roots, since $\pm 1$ are the only possibilities, and neither works. But $f$ is cubic, so this shows it is irreducible, and hence the minimal polynomimal of $\alpha$. From the constant term, we can see that $N(\alpha) = -1$, but since the minimal polynomial isn't in $\ZZ[x]$, $\alpha$ is not an algebraic integer.
\end{proof}
