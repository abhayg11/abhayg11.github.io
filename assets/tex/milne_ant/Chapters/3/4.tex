\begin{proof}
	More directly, $A$ is noetherian as the image of $k[T,U]$ under the map $T \mapsto X^2$ and $U \mapsto X^3$. \\
	
	The above realizes $A$ as the quotient $k[T,U]/(T^3-U^2)$. So, if $\frp \in A$ is a prime, it corresponds to a prime $P$ of $k[T,U]$ containing $T^3-U^2$. But this is irreducible, so $(T^3-U^2)$ is a height 1 prime and so either $P = (T^3-U^2)$, in which case $\frp = 0$ or else $P$ has height 2, making it and $\frp$ both maximal.
\end{proof}
